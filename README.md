# Hierarchical Region-level Decoupling Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation
A pytorch implenment for Hierarchical Region-level Decoupling Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation



## Training and testing

-   Training on one GPU:

```pycon
python train.py {config}
```

-   Testing on one GPU:

```pycon
python test.py {config}
```
{config} means the config path. The config path can be found in [configs](configs "configs").
